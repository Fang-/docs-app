## Docs

`%docs` is an Urbit app for documenting other Urbit apps - it finds docs in other desks and displays them for users and deveopers to browse.

The `docs` folder contains the source of the app, and the `docs-dev` folder contains the files necessary for including docs in your app. Note that the files in `docs-dev` are symlinked, so the'll need to be copied with `cp -rL` or equivalent.
