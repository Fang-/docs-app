Each desk with docs must include a `doc.clue` file in its root. The file must
contain a +$clue as defined in `/sur/docs.hoon`:

```
+$  clue  [=usr =dev]
+$  usr  (list doc)
+$  dev  (list [agent=@tas docs=(list doc)])
+$  doc    [=file title=@t]
+$  file   [name=@ta =mark ~]
```

The `.usr` part specifies user docs, and the `.dev` part specifies developer
docs.

## User

```
+$  usr  (list doc)
```

User docs only have one level: docs for the whole app. The `.usr` field will
contain a list of pairs of `+$file`s and `@t` document titles. The order the
`+$doc`s are listed will be the ordered they're displayed on the index page.

A +$file is typically specified as a +$path with two fields. The first is the
filename, and the second is the mark. For example, `/foo/udon` would be a file
called `foo.udon`.

The `.title` specified will become the title of the document and displayed at
the top when it's viewed. It'll also be the name of the document listed on the
index page.

User docs must be in the `/doc/usr` directory of the desk.

> Note: User docs are only displayed for installed %docket apps. If your desk
  isn't a %docket app with a tile, any user docs included will not be
  displayed.

Here's how `.usr` docs might look:

```
:~  [/foo/udon 'foo docs']
    [/bar/udon 'bar docs']
    [/baz/udon 'baz docs']
==
```

## Developer

```
+$  dev  (list [agent=@tas docs=(list doc)])
```

The tail of the +$clue is called `.dev` and contains developer docs. Developer
docs may have two levels: docs for the whole desk, and docs for specific agents
included in the desk. Rather than just a list of `+$doc`s like in the `.usr`
field, the `.dev` field has a list of pairs of `@tas` agents and lists of
`+$doc`s for each of those agents.

The root docs (docs for the whole desk rather than a specific agent) must have
the `.agent` set as `%$`. These will be displayed at the top of the list. The
remaining agents specified must correspond to an agent included in the desk's
`/app` directory - they'll be excluded if the agent cannot be found.

The `.file` path for each +$doc (e.g. `/foo/udon`) must correspond to a file in
the `/doc/dev/[agent]/` directory of the desk, except for the `%$` root docs
which must be in `/doc/dev` directly.

> Note: Developer docs will be displayed for %docket and non-%docket desks
  alike, but the desk must be installed.

Here's how `.dev` docs might look:

```
:~  :-  %$
    :~  [/foo/udon 'Some whole-desk docs']
        [/bar/udon 'More whole-desk docs']
    ==
    :-  %my-agent
    :~  [/blah/udon 'blah blah']
        [/etc/udon 'another doc']
    ==
    :-  %another-agent
    :~  [/foo/udon 'Foo title']
        [/bar/udon 'Bar title']
        [/baz/udon 'Baz title']
    ==
==
```

## Example

With the `.usr` and `.dev` docs together, the `doc.clue` file will look like:

```
:-
:: User docs
::
:~  [/foo/udon 'foo docs']
    [/bar/udon 'bar docs']
    [/baz/udon 'baz docs']
==
:: Developer docs
::
:~  :-  %$
    :~  [/foo/udon 'Some whole-desk docs']
        [/bar/udon 'More whole-desk docs']
    ==
    :-  %my-agent
    :~  [/blah/udon 'blah blah']
        [/etc/udon 'another doc']
    ==
    :-  %another-agent
    :~  [/foo/udon 'Foo title']
        [/bar/udon 'Bar title']
        [/baz/udon 'Baz title']
    ==
==
```

> Note: If you don't need either `.usr` or `.dev` docs, the list can just be null
  (`~`).
