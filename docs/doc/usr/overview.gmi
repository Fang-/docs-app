The Docs app displays documentation for other installed apps. All apps are automatically checked for docs, so if a particular app is not listed, it doesn't have docs.

App publishers can include documentation for ordinary users, as well as documentation for developers. You can switch between user and developer docs with the button at the top of the main page.
